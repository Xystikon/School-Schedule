Plan:
  Input: 
    - student, classes, grades
    - teachers, class(es), grade for each class 

  Constraints:
		- If two students are taking the same class but in different grades, then put them in two different periods 
		- there can be no more than 7 periods in a day
		- Teachers can only have ten students maximum per period
		- Every student must have exactly 7 periods
    - if there is a period when the student is not having class, make it 'free'
    - the same teacher can't teach two or more different grade levels at the same time 

	Outputs:
		PHASE UNO
      - return the number of active periods for a teacher 
		PHASE TWO
			- for a student name, return each period's classes
			- for a teacher name, return every period's class
      - 
	


GOAL 1: Assign periods to every student in student_dict[name][OrgClasses]

	limit of students = 2 for now?

	METHOD 1:

	iterate through the classes the student is taking 
	the first class in their list of classes becomes their first period, their second class listed becomes their second, and so only

	NEXT PART: If multiple students are in the same grade and taking a common class, regardless of period, rearrange the classes of the students so that the common class falls under the same period 

		I feel like this is too general -- what does rearrange really mean? how does it work? Wouldn't it be more efficient and a lot easier to start out by organizing?


	METHOD 2:

	sort through every class of a student, and rearrange in the same format (ex. math, biology)
	iterate through the classes and assign to periods

		Every student will have the same class type in the same order, which isn't exactly what we want.


	METHOD 3:

	iterate through every class of a student
	for every class, go to very first/only option for that student and assign that class and period
	for another student, once their classes have been iterated through,
	if the class they want has another student in it, make the student's period for that class the same as the first
	other than that, add 1 to the period

		might be a little easier to have a student limit for a class on this one.
